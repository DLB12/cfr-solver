This project uses CFR to discover the optimal strategies (represented as probability distributions of frequencies of folding, checking/calling, betting/raising to avoid exploitability) at various decision points for 100 fixed boards given imperfect information a poker player would know (ie. their own cards, the board, betting history, etc).

Every information set (imperfect information available to the player) is representable as vectors. An information set consists of the player's hand, board, betting history, and player-to-act information. Since individual cards can be represented by one-hot vectors, hands and board can be represented by multi-hot vectors. Betting history and player-to-act information can be summarized into a few crucial features (ie. number of raises) that can also be encoded by vectors. The concatenation of these vectors therefore represent the features a model takes in to  output a strategy. Essentially, the strategies the CFR algorithm discovered from the 100 fixed boards at different decision points act as training data for our machine learning model to learn the optimal strategy given arbitrary information set features.
